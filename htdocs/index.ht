<H1>The GCC toolchain for the Texas Instruments MSP430 MCUs</H1>
<P>Here you will find a port of the GCC toolchain for the Texas Instruments
MS4P430 famuly of ultra low power MCUs, This includes the GNU C compiler (GCC),
the assembler and linker (binutils), the debugger (GDB), and some other tools
needed to make complete development environment for the MSP430. These tools
can be used on Windows, Linux, BSD and most other falvours of Unix. Hoever, the
full debug environment is currently limited to Windows, Linux and BSD.
MSP430 development is no longer limited to Windows!
</P>

<P>Here is the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/">project page on SourceForge</A>
and here is the <A href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42303">download area</a>,
the <A href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=42303">CVS repository</A>.
and the <A href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=42303">mailing lists</A>.
Below is a more detailed description of the subprojects.
</P>

<H2>GCC & Binutils</H2>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The binutils is a collection of command line tools to work with assembler and object files for the MSP430.
They include <B>msp430-as</B> the assembler, <B>msp430-ld</B> the linker and <B>msp430-objcopy</B> a format
converter (e.g. create intel-hex files). The work on binutils is basicaly done. They run stable and produce
correct code. The assembler memnonics are compatible with the TI syntax, the control commands and segment names
are in GNU style.
</P>

<P>From the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) we're porting the <B>C compiler</B> (C++ partly done).
</P><P>GNU C is a full featured compiler:
ANSI C89 compatible, different levels of optimization, inline assembly, interrupt handlers
(incl. "wakeup"), floating point etc.
</P>

<P>A C compiler isn't complete without its library. We provide a basic libc as well as libgcc and crts. These
libraries contain math-, string- and other functions along with startup- and initialization code. Whereas libgcc is
included in the gcc sources, the libc and crt files are a separate package.</P>

<P>Where to get? Not for all subprojects are archives available.
But you can easily download the latest sources with CVS. This procedure is explained
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=42303">here</a>.
Look in the <A href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42303">
download area</a> for archives.

<P><A href="contribute.html">Contributions</A> are highly welcome. Comments and bug reports are
appreciated.
If you can test the tools, let us know of success or failure (bugs). When you want
to extend the libraries or add new features, let us know. This is an open source project
where everyone can make the product better.
</P>


<P><B>Mailing list</B><br>
Whe have a mailing list for discussions about the MSP430 and GCC. You can subscribe to
mspgcc-users on <A href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=42303">this page</A>.
