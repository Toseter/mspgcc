This directory contains files that add/enhance support for the Texas
Instruments MSP430 family of microcontrollers in open-source toolchains.
The material incorporated is maintained in a git repository hosted at:

 git://mspgcc.git.sourceforge.net/mspgcc/mspgcc

"legacy" refers to toolchain enhancements that hard-code the peripherals and
addresses belonging to specific microcontrollers into the toolchain source.

Build and install a complete toolchain by building each of the following
tools in order:

  binutils
  gcc
  gdb
  msp430-libc

The source for the first three is obtained by applying patches in this
directory to the upstream distributions of the generic tools.  The patches
include information on how to build the distribution.

msp430-libc is a standalone library obtained separately at:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc4/files/msp430-libc/
