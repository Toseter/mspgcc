This directory contains files that add/enhance support for the Texas
Instruments MSP430 family of microcontrollers in open-source toolchains.
The material incorporated is maintained in a git repository hosted at:

 git://mspgcc.git.sourceforge.net/mspgcc/mspgcc

Build and install a complete toolchain by building each of the following
tools in order:

  binutils
  gcc
  gdb
  msp430mcu
  msp430-libc

The source for the first three is obtained by applying patches in this
directory to the upstream distributions of the generic tools.  The patches
include information on how to build the distribution.

msp430mcu provides C headers and binutils linker scripts for each of the
over 300 microcontrollers in the MSP430 family.  It is released as an
independent package and can be obtained at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/msp430mcu/msp430mcu-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2

where YYYYMMDD is provided in the file msp430mcu.version in this release.  A
.zip file is available as well.

msp430-libc provides C library routines.  It is released as an independent
package and can be obtained at:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/msp430-libc/msp430-libc-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2

where YYYYMMDD is provided in the file msp430-libc.version in this release.  A
.zip file is available as well.

** Please report all problems with this toolchain on the mspgcc bug tracker
   at:

**WARNING** The documentation portions of this package are in progress, and
  may be out of date in significant ways.
